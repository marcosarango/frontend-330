    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <h4> Novice to Ninja</h4>
    <li>window.navigator.userAgent tells info about the user's browser, but this may not always be accurate because it
        can be changed manually by the user.</li>
    <li>window.location.href, window.location.protocol, window.location.host, window.location.port,
        window.location.pathname, window.location.search, window.location.hash, window.location.origin,
        window.location.assign('https://www.sitepoint.com/'), window.location.toString()
        are all referenced in this chapter. I'm listing them here as a reference point if I need them to go back and
        look them up. </li>
    <li>The Browser History - window.history.go(1); // goes forward 1 page</li>
    <li>A new window can be opened using the window.open() method. This takes the URL of the page to be opened as its
        first parameter, the window title as its second parameter, and a list of attributes as the third parameter.
    </li>
    <li>popup.close(), window.moveTo(0,0); // will move the window to the top-left corner of the screen,
        window.resizeTo(600,400);</li>
    <li>More Properties: window.screen.height, window.screen.width, window.screen.availWidth, window.screen.availHeight,
        window.screen.colorDepth;</li>
    <h4>Cookies</h4>
    <li>document.cookie = 'name=Superman';</li>
    <li>You can set the cookie to expire later than when a user closes the browser, say one day.</li>
    <li>Example: document.cookie = 'name=Batman; max-age=86400' // 86400 secs = 1 day</li>
    <li>Adding the string ; secure to the end of a cookie will ensure itâ€™s only transmitted over a secure HTTPS network.
    </li>
    <li>To delete a cookie, you need to set it to expire at a time in the past: document.cookie = 'name=Batman;
        expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:01 GMT';</li>
    <h4>Timing Functions</h4>
     <li>The window.setTimeout() method accepts a callback to a function as its first parameter and a number of
        milliseconds as its second parameter. </li>
    <li>clearInterval() and clearTimeout() will help clear out the things you don't need anymore.</li>
    <li>setTimeOut() and setInterval() can help create animations. Let's see if I can make one below this list item.
    </li>

    <h4>Factorizor</h4>
    <button id='rainbow'>Change Color</button>
    <form>
        <label for='number'>Enter a Number to Factorize:</label>
        <input id='number' type='number' name='number' min=1 value='20'>
        <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
    </form>
    <div id='output'></div>

    <p>Couldn't really get this message thing to work, so this would be a question I have, is how to get it working.</p>
    <form>
        <label for='message'>Enter a Message:</label>
        <input type='text' name='message'>
        <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
    </form>
    <div id='websocketoutput'></div>

    <h4>Multimedia</h4>
    <li>You used to not be able to display video and audio without Adobe Flash. Now they have a video tag and an audio
        tag.</li>
    <audio src='/song.mp3' controls>
            Your browser does not support the audio element.
        </audio>
    <li>I don't actually have a song to the aduio file above, but just wanted to include the html to see what it would
        do.</li>
    <li>The audio or video element can be referenced by a variable using one of the DOM methods we saw in Chapter 6: const audio = document.getElementsByTagName('audio')[0];</li>
    <li>The play() method will start the clip playing from its current position: video.play();</li>
    <li>There are lots of properties to go with it: volume, muted, currentTime, playbackRate, loop, duration.</li>
