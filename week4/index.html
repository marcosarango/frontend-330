    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <h4>Chapter 8 (Forms)</h4>


    <h3>Chapter 12 - Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript</h3>
    <li>There are Constructor functions. They look like this:</li>
    <p>const Dice = function(sides=6){<br> this.sides = sides;<br> this.roll = function() {<br> return
        Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)<br> }
        <br> }
    </p>
    <li>What's important to note is the "this" keyword. It is used to represent the object that will be returned by the
        constructor function.</li>
    <li>An "instance" of the above code looks like this using the "new" operator:</li>
    <p>const redDice = new Dice();</p>
    <li>So they assigned that whole object to a new variable called redDice. </li>
    <h4>Class Declarations</h4>
    <li>Constructor functions are good, but class declarations are better. Here's code that is better than above:</li>
    <p>class Dice {<br> constructor(sides=6) {<br> this.sides = sides;<br> }
        <br> roll() {<br> return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)<br> }
        <br>
    
    <h4>A golden rule to remember is:Never use arrays or objects as a default value in prototype.</h4>
    <li>I'm not sure what this means. I'd like to see an example of using arrays or objects as the default value.</li>
    <h4>Inheritance</h4>
    <li>Extends is a way to inherit all the parent class qualities. The book gave the example of creating a ninja
        turtles class using the extension of turtles as the parent class.</li>
    <li>Inside the constructor, if you are going to use the same variable name to assign it to a new inherited class,
        you use the keyword "super."</li>
    <h4>Property Descriptors</h4>
    
    <li>So when you are setting attributes inside this method, you can use the "writeable" keyword and set it to false.
        Then you can't change the value of it. It's a security measure.</li>
    <li>Here's an example: Object.defineProperty(me, 'eyeColor', { value: 'blue', writable: false, enumerable: true });
        results { name: 'DAZ' , age: 21, eyeColor: 'blue' }</li>
    <li>So in the example above, we are setting or "definingProperty" of eyeColor to the value of blue, it can't be
        overwritten because writable is set to false, and it can be numbered or counted because enumerable is set to
        true.</li>
    <li>enumerable ― this boolean value shows whether a property will show up when the object is displayed in a for in
        loop, and is false by default</li>
    <li>configurable ― this boolean value shows whether you can delete a property or change any of its attributes, and
        is false by default.</li>
    <li>getOwnPropertyDesciptor() method - get's the values in a object function.</li>
    <li>Obejct.defineProperty() method - allows each attribute to be set.</li>


    <h4>Mixin Function</h4>
    
    <li>Mixin functions can use the copy() function to create a deep copy.</li>
    <li>If a method returns "this", methods can be chained together. </li>
    <li>Sometimes, this gets tricky because "this" can refer to a global object.</li>
    <li>mixin() is a function where you can make deep copies of objects, arrays. Instead of just referencing another
        object, making a deep copy can be useful.</li>
    <li>You can use mixins to add multiple properties at once.</li>
    <li>mixin(wonderWoman,{ name: 'Wonder Woman', realName: 'Diana Prince' });</li>

    <li>The value of this is not retained inside nested functions, which can cause errors. This can be worked around by
        using that = this , using the bind(this) method and using arrow functions.</li>
